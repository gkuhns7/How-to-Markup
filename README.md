## Steps
1. Wash your hands with soap and warm water.

2. Collect necessary materials.
     - place all items on a flat surface 
     - preferably somewhere easy to sit
     
3. Clip each nail so that they are all around the same length. 

4. After clipping, file nails into a shape of your choosing. 
    -  almond, square and coffin are all examples of nail shapes
    
5. Open your polish and apply a thin coat to every nail making sure to avoid your cuticles. Let these dry for approximately 10 mins. 
    - use long brush strokes for an even coverage

6. Apply a second coat of nail polish once the first is dry to the touch.
7. Next, apply nail polish remover to the end of a q-tip or cotton swab and clean up anywhere that the polish missed your nail.  
8. Add a top coat to seal in your polish after allowing the second coat to dry.
9. Finally, add cuticle oil to your nail beds. 
    - this will give your nails a glowy, hydrated look. 

10. Let dry for no less than an hour or overnight for best results.
